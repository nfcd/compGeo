# Computational Geosciences
Welcome to the Computational Geosciences resource at the University of Stavanger (UiS), Norway. This is an educational project funded by the Faculty of Science and Technology at UiS. The resource is made by students and faculty from the departments of Energy Resources (IER) and Mechanical and Structural Engineering (IMBM). 

Students: Angela Hoch (IER), Adham Amer (IMBM), Vania Mansoor and Linda Olsen (IER).

Postdocs: David Oakley (IER) 

Faculty: Nestor Cardozo (IER), Lisa Watson (IER), Wiktor Weibull (IER), and Knut Giljarhus (IMBM). 

Please feel free to use this material for teaching and research. If you have any comments or want to contribute to the resource, please contact me at [nestor.cardozo@uis.no](mailto:nestor.cardozo@uis.no)

## Manual: Working with the resource
The resource consists of a book in pdf format (compGeo.pdf), and a source folder where data, functions and notebooks are included. The book is a large, full-resolution file (18 MB).

The programming language of choice is Python, and our approach is as follows: We introduce briefly the theory and applications, implement them in Python functions, and illustrate them using Jupyter notebooks. 

### Clone the repository
The best way to work with the resource is to clone this repository. This saves all material to your local machine. It behaves almost like a copy.
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the folder where you would like to store the local copy of the repository. (`cd <foldername>`)
3. Press the green button 'Code' on the right hand side and copy the path in the Clone section.
4. Execute the terminal command `git clone <fill in path here>`.
5. Now you can start working with the resource files. They are saved in the folder you chose in step 2.

### Updating your local files
Once in a while you should update your local files to the latest changes in the repository. This is important since we will be making changes and including new chapters along.
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate inside the folder of the repository on your machine. (`cd <foldername>`)
3. Execute the terminal command `git pull`

## Background information
The notebooks follow the directory structure of the resource, which is based on data, functions and notebooks folders. We recommend that you follow the same directory structure when running the notebooks. 

## Current state
The first nine chapters are completed. The latest revision of these chapters on Aug. 2024 was significant. Please update. The last chapter (Ch. 10) on the inversion problem is in progress.
