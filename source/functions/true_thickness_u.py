	"""
	true_thickness_u calculates the thickness (t) of a unit
	given the strike (stk) and dip (dip) of the unit,
	and points at its top (top) and base (base).
	stk and dip, as well as the points have
	uncertainties.
	
	top and base are 1 x 3 arrays defining the location
	of top and base points in an ENU coordinate system.
	For each one of these arrays, the first, second
	and third entries are the E, N and U coordinates.
	These coordinates have uncertainties
	
	NOTE: stk and dip should be input in radians and
		they have uncertainties in radians. The
		returned thickness has also uncertainties
